# Study Site

## Description

 The motivation for this project is a career change into tech. Creating more projects only helps build my codeing skills.
 I built this project to learn how to use some tools that will be essential to my codeing journey, also to give me an introduction to what will be expected to be learned.
 This project contains notes that can remind the user of past topics. It saves the user time by choosing what topic you should study. One of the powerful tools I learned was using git. Its abilitys of creating branches to isolate new pieces of code was very new to me. Also, I learned how to create html, css, and javascript files within the version control system.
